Cloudflare Web Analytics is a new player on the simple, privacy-first and de-Googled web analytics market.

Here's a look at what Cloudflare Web Analytics does and how it compares to Plausible Analytics and other analytics tools such as Google Analytics.

## What is Cloudflare Analytics?

Cloudflare offers a couple of similar sounding products: Cloudflare Analytics and Cloudflare Web Analytics.

Cloudflare Analytics is a server-side analytics tool similar to server logs. You don't need to insert any JavaScript snippet on your site. You just need to change your DNS or use Cloudflare's proxy to get access to these stats. 

Like other server logs, Cloudflare Analytics is wildly inaccurate as all the bots and other spam is included in the stats. You can read more about [client side vs server side web analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis) and the gap in the data between them.

Cloudflare Analytics is a premium product for the paying customers who use their other services to improve their sites' performance and security.

Cloudflare has recently launched Cloudflare Web Analytics and this is their response to Google Analytics and other web analytics tools such as Plausible Analytics. 

It works client side using a JavaScript script that you need to insert into your site. And unlike their other analytics product, Cloudflare Web Analytics is free to use. 

This is how they describe it: "Our analytics don't cookie your visitors, collect their personal information, or track them across sites. So if your site needs a cookie banner, it won't be because of us".

That sounds pretty much like [what Plausible does too](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics), so Cloudflare Web Analytics is what we'll compare Plausible Analytics to in this post.
 
## Plausible vs Cloudflare Web Analytics comparison: What are the differences? 

Even though both Plausible and Cloudflare Web Analytics are built to be simple to use, privacy-friendly and lightweight, there are some important differences too. Let's explore them.

## Cloudflare Analytics restricts you to 7 days of data

The maximum viewable range for your Cloudflare Web Analytics dashboard is 7 days. They are "working on extending the queryable time range to 30 days for Business plan users". The business plan is not free and starts at $200 per month.

On the free plan, you lose access to everything that happened more than a week ago. It seems to be deleted as there's no way to retrieve it. 

This is a dealbreaker for many people who use analytics. It is very common to compare larger data sets ranging from a month on month comparison, quarter on quarter or even year on year. 

This may be a great way for Cloudflare to reduce their cost when providing a product free of charge but 7 or 30 days of historical data is not that useful for most site owners.

When using Plausible Analytics, there are no limitations on how much data you can store. You can view any of the data we've counted about your website since you installed the Plausible Analytics script and you can do so at any time that you wish. No data restrictions whatsoever. 

## Cloudflare Analytics is inaccurate

Some stats that Cloudflare Analytics displays are a bit weird and inaccurate. In the past, their dashboard used to have a note that all stats are "based on a 1%-10% sample of requests". 

They've since removed that note from the dashboard but the stats look a bit weird which probably means they're still doing some kind of sampling.

What does that mean? Cloudflare Web Analytics may not show the actual stats from your site. They take a subset of all of the data they collect (1% to 10% of your total traffic), analyze it and display an assumption based on the patterns seen in the sample they analyzed.

This is another great way for them to reduce their running costs for providing this free product but it leads to inaccurate data. 

Just compare these two charts for top pages. Same website and same time period but obviously inaccurate numbers on the Cloudflare dashboard compared to the Plausible dashboard.

Cloudflare:

Plausible:

Another inaccuracy comes from the fact that Cloudflare Web Analytics doesn't seem to do much bot detection.

Plausible Analytics doesn't use data sampling at all so all the stats in your dashboard is 100% accurate data of what happens on your site. No data sampling means that you can make your decisions based on 100% accurate real-world stats.

## Cloudflare Analytics limits you to one website only

You can only add one domain name or one website to your Cloudflare Analytics account. They have announced that they plan to "add support for multiple analytics properties per account" but this is not currently the case.

Plausible Analytics doesn't have any limits on the number of websites you can add to your account. Add as many websites as you want and get access to all of them from the same account.

## Cloudflare Analytics limits you to 15 items on any report

You can only see the top 15 of your pages, referral sources, countries and so on in your Cloudflare Analytics dashboard. Full lists are not available which makes it difficult to work with larger data sets or sites with a higher number of visitors. 

You could use the filter to manually input a specific page or specific referral source to try and dig those stats up but there's no easy way to discover them.

The filtering process is slow and inconvenient and goes something like this. To see stats for one of your pages outside of the top 15, you need to:

* Click on "Add filter"
* Select "Path" as the filter
* Then type in the page URL if you can remember what it is
* Click on "Apply"

Plausible Analytics doesn't have any limits on the number of items we show in the individual reports. Have hundreds of pages or hundreds of referral sources? Keep scrolling within your Top Pages or Top Sources lists. Same goes for countries, goals and other metrics within other reports.

## Cloudflare Analytics limits the number of metrics you can get access to

Cloudflare Analytics is too basic even for the [simple web analytics](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics) tools such as Plausible Analytics. 

Here are some of the metrics missing on Cloudflare Analytics compared to what you can get on Plausible Analytics:

* No live view or live dashboard so you cannot see what's happening on your site right now
* No visit duration so you cannot figure out how long people stay on your site or judge the quality of a referral source
* No bounce rate so you cannot analyze the quality of different pages or referral sources
* No UTM campaign stats so you cannot track your marketing campaigns and minimize the dark traffic
* No goal and event tracking so you cannot figure out whether people are taking action you're focused on and you cannot track things such as [external link clicks](https://plausible.io/blog/track-outbound-link-clicks)
* No way to use a custom domain so the Cloudflare Analytics script is blocked by many browsers and extensions which means fewer of your visitors get counted

## Cloudflare Analytics is lightweight compared to Google Analytics but it's still 6x heavier than Plausible

Cloudflare Analytics JavaScript file that you need to integrate into your site to start tracking visitors is 4.3 KB.

This is a big improvement compared to the 45.7 KB that Google Analytics integration adds to your page weight but it's still 6 times heavier than the Plausible Analytics default script which is at 0.7 KB. 

Why is Cloudflare Analytics script so heavy despite not displaying much data in the dashboard? Looking at the contents of the script, they seem to be collecting a lot of data points about page loading speed and performance. 

This could be a feature they plan to add in the future versions of the dashboard but it is also a way for them to gather business intelligence to improve their premium products.

If you want the most [lightweight web analytics](https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics), Plausible is the lighter choice.

## Different definitions of what a unique visitor is

Plausible Analytics and Cloudflare Analytics have a different definition of what a unique visitor is.

Like Plausible Analytics, Cloudflare Analytics doesn't use cookies nor local storage to track visitors so a different method of counting is necessary.
 
In Cloudflare Analytics, "a visit is a successful page view that has an HTTP referrer that doesn't match the hostname of the request".

Basically Cloudflare Analytics counts the number of times someone landed on any page of your site from another site. They say that "you should expect this number to differ from other analytics tools". 

This is because it may differ greatly from other analytics tools depending on the type of site and audience you're attracting. 

If the same person visits your site 10 times in one day, Cloudflare Web Analytics lists that visitor as 10 different unique visitors while tools such as Plausible Analytics will show that person as 1 unique visitor.

Plausible Analytics doesn't attempt to generate a device-persistent identifier either because these are considered personal data under GDPR.

Instead, we generate a daily changing identifier using the visitorâ€™s IP address and User Agent. To anonymize these datapoints, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt. You can learn more about our method in [our data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

## Open source vs closed source web analytics

Plausible Analytics is a fully [open-source web analytics](https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics) tool. Our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can read it and review it to ensure it keeps the data private and secure. Plausible can even be self-hosted for those who want to manage their own server infrastructure.

This is not the case with Cloudflare Analytics which is a closed source product. There's simply no way of knowing what's going on behind the scenes when using the Cloudflare Analytics script. 

This doesn't necessary have to mean anything bad as Cloudflare unlike Google has no interest in the ad-tech world, it simply means that you have to put your trust in Cloudflare.

## Paid vs Free (and David vs Goliath)

Cloudflare Analytics is a product made by one of the largest corporations in the world. A company that has many different money-generating products which allows them to provide their analytics for free as a way to get more customers to their main line of business.

It is also a company that is not specialized in web analytics which shows in the way they've built their analytics dashboard with inconveniences such as not having an easy access to view the data for today.

Plausible, on the other hand, is by a small, bootstrapped and independent team. And web analytics is what we do so our focus is 100% on our web analytics product. 

It costs money to develop and manage a web analytics service. This is why we charge a subscription fee for our plans. It helps us run a sustainable business that we can work on full time. By using Plausible, you will support indie-developers, indie-businesses and the independent web. 
 
Cloudflare chooses to make their web analytics a free product but they cut the costs of running that free service by using aggressive data sampling and strict data history limitations.

If you're curious about Plausible Analytics, we have a 30-day free trial you can use without any restrictions or limitations. There's also no credit card required to sign up for the trial. [Learn more here](https://plausible.io/register).
