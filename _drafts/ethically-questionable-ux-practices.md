title: For side projects, consistency is more important than the rate of progress
---

Since the very beginning of my career, I've been building side projects. However,
I've never been good at _finishing_ them. Plausible is the project I've taken the furthest and
I want to share how I'm managing to stay productive while maintaining a full-time job.

Plausible is my first side project that I actually got to a point of releasing to
customers. Today I can celebrate 50 active beta users. It's not much but the trajectory
is looking good and I'm proud of getting to where it is now.

Before Plausible, here's how all of my side projects went:

1. Have a great idea
2. Start coding rapidly
3. Lose interest after X weeks
4. Go to step 1

Sound familiar? Here's how I managed to break this pattern.

### Create accountability

When things get difficult at work, I always manage to push through and still get it done even if I don't enjoy it.
Why can I do it at work but not with side projects?

I think it's because there's not a lot riding
on it with side projects. It's so easy to give up. There are no disappointed customers, no
angry bosses, no sense of failure. You just stop working on it and no-one cares.

So before prototyping the beta version of Plausible, I wrote a blog post to explain the product
I'm trying to build. I sent it to a number of my friends and about 5 of them were interested.
I promised to let them know when the beta is ready.

I also told this group that I would ship the beta in January 2019. Committing
to a deadline is a great way to create accountability. It forced me to
figure out what's important and ruthlessly limit the scope of the MVP.

Of course startup and marketing people will tell me that I should have validated
the idea way more before building it. That I should have had a list of 100 interested customers before
even thinking about writing any code. They're probably right, but a group of 5 is a lot better than 0.

The point is that coding is not the right way to start a side project that you have hopes of turning into a business.
Talk to people, make it known what you're builing. Have at least a small group of people who
expect progress from you. Tell them when to expect that progress and make a commitment.

Knowing that there are people waiting for the beta of Plausible motivated me to push
through the phase of the project where normally I would have lost interest. The
extra accountability I had to this small group made me push through
times where pure intrinsic motivation would not have been sufficient.

### Staying consistent

The second thing I'm doing differently with Plausible is time management. Instead
of trying to sprint to the finish line I focus more on being consistent and sustainable.

I suppose this is part of a wider realization I've had: consistency is often more important
than the rate of progress. This goes for excercise, diet, relationships, productivity, etc.
If you're making progress consistently, no matter how small the rate of progress, you will eventually
reach your goal.

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit

So I'm doing my best to make consistent progress on Plausible.
My goal is to do one measurable thing each day to help the project move forward.
I often limit how much I work on it in a single evening or weekend as well.
Even though I could keep going, I force myself to close the laptop because I
prioritize being fresh the day after.

Today, for example, I'm taking a couple hours to write this post but I'm not spending
any more time on the project because I'm feeling a bit tired. In the past I would have tried to
push through and ship a feature today as well. Now I know better to stop and
get my mind off work stuff. Tomorrow is another day.

The way I think about it is that I want my github activity chart to have many light green dots
instead of a few dark green dots with periods of inactivity in between. Consistency is key.
This is why maker sites like wip.chat count your streak and push you to work on the project
every day. When you get a sense of accmplishment each day, your motivation will only keep growing
with the momentum.

### Take breaks

Where wip.chat breaks down is it rewards people with the longest streak. The longest shipping streak
on their front page currently is 369 days. That means someone has worked more than full calendar year
on their project without taking a single day off.

For some habits, this is fine. If you're trying to eat better, you don't necessarily need to take
breaks to succeed. Most people still have cheat days but they are not essential
for keeping up with the habit. You can eat healthy for 369 days straight and it won't hurt
your progress at all.

However, knowledge work is different. Over time, stress and worries start building up.
Perspective starts skewing towards insignificant details instead of the big picture. Sense
of progress and momentum can actually be lost if you don't regularly take a step back
to appreciate how far you've come.

This is why I take at least one weekend per month where I don't do any work on anything at all.
Every few months I also take a holiday to either travel or visit family. In either case I can
distance myself from work and clear my head.

Tomorrow, I'm getting on a plane to Switzerland for some skiing action. I'm excited for the skiing,
but I'm also excited to return after the week with a renewed perspective and motivation for Plausible.

### Less is more

I have not mastered the art of sticking with things and finishing them, but I'm getting better.
My most important insight is to do less, force yourself to take breaks, and worry more about
consistency than the speed of progress. If you presume even a tiny rate of improvement, over time
you'll reach your goals.

I've been recommended the book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear.
I think I will pick it up next to learn more about building habits. Thinking about my side project
as a habit has been helpful to maintain progress.
