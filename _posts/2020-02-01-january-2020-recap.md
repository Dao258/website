title: 'Building Plausible: January 2020 recap'
date: 2020-02-01
---

I havenâ€™t been regular with updates on how Plausible is doing, but I intend to put more effort into this blog this year. Letâ€™s kick things off with the highlights for January 2020:

* ðŸš€ **Shipped bounce rate:** This was a highly requested statistic to add to the dashboard.
* ðŸš€ **Shipped shared URLs:** Stats can now be shared with others using private, password-protected links.
* ðŸ’µ **MRR: $355 (+0%):** Monthly revenue stayed level in January.
* ðŸ‘© **1.8k visitors (+47%):** Visitor numbers are pretty strong, got some unexpected traffic from Twitter and Github.

What jumps out is that this was the first month where Plausible had no revenue growth. I had a normal amount of signups and activations, but a higher-than-normal number of cancellations.

I reached out to the people who cancelled to see if thereâ€™s a common reason. Just two people replied, saying that they canâ€™t justify the price anymore.

No reason to freak out about this. Churn is natural and I think itâ€™s bad luck that all of these cancellations happened within one month.

### Plans for February

Iâ€™ll keep working on product development and hopefully ship some big features in February. Here's what I'm focusing on:

* **Configurable site id:** [More info here](https://feedback.plausible.io/31)
* **Show tweet referrals:** I've been working with the Twitter API to see if Plausible can give you more information on traffic coming
from Twitter.
* **UX updates:** I think the main dashboard is due for a visual update. I'm looking at how to best use available screen real-estate to
communicate more information without losing clarity.

Iâ€™m also waiting for [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) and [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) to finally release [Tailwind UI](https://www.tailwindui.com/). Once they do, I can incorporate some of their design work into Plausible.

I've really enjoyed working with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) on this project. I have a draft blog post on why I'm such
a fan of utility-first CSS and Tailwind in particular. I'm going to finish editing and get it published on a popular front-end blog soon.

I will use this blog as sort of a journal this year to record the journey of building and growing Plausible. Stay tuned for more monthly updates like this.
