[Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) recently relaunched as the no-cookie, GDPR/CCPA/PECR compliant alternative to Google Analytics. We had some very eventful days and here's what we learned.

We released a new product update, new website and the first blog post in a new series and this resulted in us breaking all of our website traffic and trial signup records. We were also overwhelmed with feedback, comments and ideas.

Here's an overview of all the things we've done in our product push over the last couple of weeks and lessons learned that may help the rest of the indie startup community get their products out to more people too.

## Results of the first week after the "relaunch"

The results were overwhelmingly positive. 

* To the date of the new promotional push, we had achieved 27,300 unique visitors in total in about 15 months. **We got more than 48,000 unique visitors in the first week** after publishing alone.
* **We also got 166 new trials in the first week** which was more than we got in the four months before that combined. 
* **We got more than [1,400 developers](https://github.com/plausible-insights/plausible/graphs/traffic) to look at our GitHub page** where our code is.
* **Google featured our post in the Discover section of the Google app**. This resulted in almost 200,000 impressions and almost 7,000 clicks. 
* We got a **boost of more than 300% in the number of impressions and clicks on Google's search results**. 
* One interesting fact is that only 10 people searched for "Plausible Analytics" on Google in the week before the post and 121 searched for the same phrase the week after. This shows that the post made a difference in **making more people aware of our product**. The hope is that this will stick with our future activities. 
* The post was also **featured in some roundup articles, top lists of the day and even email newsletters** that share some of the best content of the week.
* On top of the visitor numbers and the new trials, **we got hundreds of comments on different forums and social media**. Some influential figures including [Rand Fishkin](https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1247934239808475137) and [April Dunford](https://twitter.com/aprildunford/status/1247986144517767169) shared our post. Other startups reached out to us too and there's even an invite to be a guest on a popular podcast. 
* One interesting feature of Plausible Analytics is the fact that you can **open your dashboard and share your website stats with the public**. We've done that so you can follow our stats on this [live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io).

So this "relaunch" changed the traction of our startup, the goalposts have moved. Here's a deeper look into the actions we took.

## Revamp of the product, website and blog

Running a startup is about releasing new features and building a better product, but marketing and communication play a very prominent role too.

### Latest Plausible Analytics product update

We released the latest update to the Plausible Analytics product. It was a popular feature request on [our public roadmap](https://plausible.nolt.io/newest). Plausible Analytics now works without cookies out of the box. You no longer need to have the cookie banner and you no longer need to obtain consent to store cookies if you use Plausible Analytics.

### New Plausible Analytics website

![New Plausible Analytics home page positioning](/uploads/new-home-page-positioning.png "New Plausible Analytics home page positioning")

This was a big feature for us so we decided to change and improve the home page at the same time. The thinking behind the new home page was to position us more clearer as a Google Analytics alternative.

It is a fact that most websites use Google Analytics for their website tracking and that many of the people that sign up for Plausible usually do so by coming from Google Analytics. On our new home page, we wanted to explain to people what Plausible does and how it differs from Google Analytics. 

It's a David vs Goliath-like situation as we're a brand new startup while Google Analytics is installed on more than half of all the websites online. The idea was to focus on things that we do differently and perhaps even better than Google Analytics. There's no other way that a startup can compete with a market leader.

### New Plausible Analytics individual product pages

To better explain what Plausible Analytics does, we published several pages where we go into detail on the different features and the different ways that Plausible works. 

To come up with these differentiators, we looked at what Google does wrong in our eyes, we collected all the feedback we had from our customers, from people running websites and from researching things people talk about and search for online. These features of Plausible fall into several categories:

* [Simple to use](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics): One of the main things people struggle with Google Analytics is the fact that it is too overwhelming. There are more than 100 different reports you get access to and almost 300 different metrics. Plausible Analytics presents everything you need to know at a glance so you can have more time to focus on your site.
* [Lightweight script](https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics): Google Analytics with the Google Manager Tag adds 45.7 KB to the page size. This may seem very little but every KB matters if you want to speed up the page speed. And Google Analytics script can hurt the site speed. Plausible Analytics is only 1.4 KB which helps you keep your website fast.
* [Compliant with privacy regulations](https://plausible.io/data-policy): Google Analytics places cookies and collects a lot of data from the visitors of websites. You're required to have a privacy policy, to show a cookie banner and to obtain consent for GDPR if you use Google Analytics. Plausible Analytics doesn't use cookies and doesn't track personal data so you don't need to annoy your visitors or worry about those prompts.
* [Open source](https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics): Google Analytics is a closed source, proprietary product. It's impossible to know what's going on behind the scenes and you need to put your trust in Google. Plausible Analytics is open source with our code being publicly [accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/plausible-insights/plausible).

### New Plausible Analytics comparisons with the most popular providers

To make matters even clearer for potential customers and help them make the best choice, we also published two different comparison posts putting Plausible Analytics head-to-head against the main website analytics providers.

* **Google Analytics** is the biggest site analytics platform on the web. 85% of sites that use web analytics use Google Analytics. Here's the [Plausible Analytics vs Google Analytics](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics) post.
* **Matomo (formerly known as Piwik)** is the most well-known open source alternative. It is used by 1.5% of all websites that use web analytics. We also published a [Plausible Analytics vs Matomo](https://plausible.io/vs-matomo) comparison.

Both of these analytics products are well known by different web developers and site owners. It helps us help them easier figure out what the differences are why Plausible Analytics might be worth a look.

## How we do marketing for Plausible Analytics

As a bootstrapped startup that is focused on providing a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics, we have also decided not to focus on the traditional way of promoting a startup. Many startups promote themselves using paid advertising on Google, Facebook and similar. This makes them a part of the [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) industry as targeted paid advertising requires a lot of personal data.

It's also a very expensive and competitive way of doing marketing that few without venture funding can afford in the long run. We may experiment with more ethical and privacy-friendly paid advertising in the future, but we're focused on organic marketing for now as we believe that has the biggest potential.

### So if you don't use paid advertising, how do you attract an audience?

Content marketing has a big role to play here. We aim to publish content that helps people out. That may mean that we answer relevant questions that people have. Or that we solve major relevant issues people are struggling with. 

**Content marketing doesn't bring instant results like paid advertising does**. You may put in time and effort to create a great post, and when you publish it, nobody might be there to see it. If you start an advertising campaign now, on the other hand, chances are that you will see a few clicks immediately. 

Content marketing is a long term game. Unlike paid advertising which in most cases stops delivering results as soon as you stop paying for it, content marketing can deliver results weeks, months and even years after the original work has been done. It takes a dedicated and concentrated strategic effort over a longer period of time to start seeing results but they stick for longer too.

The first post we published in a new series on our blog was the obvious choice. A product that everyone in our target audience knows and has direct experience with. Google Analytics. 

Some love, some hate it, some don't care. Some use it on all sites, some spend hours on it daily, most used it at least once in the past and everyone has an opinion. We published a post that looked into reasons why a site owner should [stop using Google Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics) on their site.

It took a few days to research, write and edit and then we had almost 2,500 words of very relevant content that would be interesting to many people in our audience. We published the post. This is where many people make a mistake and think that after publishing all the work is done. That's false. The promotional work starts after the post has been published.

### Promotional activities after publishing a new post

After the content is published we need to try and see how we can reach a relevant audience of people interested in it. Plausible is still very small and we don't have a large audience, so any content that we publish without taking any steps to actually share it with people will most probably go unnoticed. 

Especially in the early days of your startup, it's really important to **take some steps to proactively go out there and share your message**. Don't spam people. Don't go irrelevant places. Find relevant communities and sites where people have shown interest in the topic you're covering, join those communities and engage with them, and then share when you have something interesting to share.

We shared the post on our Twitter and Mastodon accounts, we shared it on [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/why-you-should-stop-using-google-analytics-on-your-website-4050ba09da), [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/cdrrty/why_you_should_stop_using_google), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22813168) and [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/fx79ov/why_you_should_stop_using_google_analytics_on/) too. At this stage with the post being in those communities, the things are really out of your hands. Will the community pick it up or not? Will they ignore it? Will we get lucky so some people have a look before the post gets lost in hundreds of other posts, threads and submissions?

We got lucky with this post. And this is where the main spike in traffic came from.

## Early lessons learned from this new direction

* **Find some areas where the market leader is lacking and design a replacement and an alternative** with a focus on those. This will help you to easier get your message across to people. You should not try to design a clone, a full-blown replacement and a feature-by-feature reproduction of the market leader. You don't need to cover all the different use-cases of the most popular product. 
* **Don't hide the fact that a popular competitor and a market leader exists.** People know. Rather than pretend they don't exist, use their existence to your advantage. Create a product with features that fill their gaps. Clearly explain the differences between your product and the biggest player on the market. Publish comparison posts where you go into the details on these differences. List reasons why your major competitor is flawed and explain what makes your solution a viable alternative.
* **You don't necessarily need a huge social media following.** Plausible Analytics doesn't (yet?) have official and active social media profiles but it doesn't mean that we cannot get traffic from social media. Most social media platforms these days focus on algorithmic newsfeeds. In cases such as Facebook, the organic reach of posts from brands and brand pages is demoted compared to posts from actual people. This means that getting real people to share your content has a higher chance of getting reach in you sharing it yourself. So again by creating interesting and useful content, we tried to incentivize more people to share our message too.
* **Share the post that you've created**. If you've put a lot of effort into creating a great post and you're proud of it, make sure to share it with the world too. If you don't put some effort into promoting the good work you've done, the chances it will go unnoticed and people won't discover it. 
* **Monitor the conversation, listen, engage and act on insightful feedback.** We got so much feedback on social, via email, different forums and even on GitHub. Some added useful feedback such as [this](https://github.com/plausible-insights/plausible/issues/52) very insightful look into how we can make our script even lighter and [this](https://github.com/plausible-insights/plausible/pull/53) contribution for Docker. We've acted on a lot of the feedback already and done some fixes. Such as the addition of pricing to the top navigation bar, updated and hand-crafted privacy policy, more clarification about pricing and various fixes to the website. There's also a list of feature ideas for us to work in our public roadmap.
* **Don't be unhappy about the negative feedback.** Be grateful that people care enough to comment and write to you in the first place. Some Hacker News feedback was that we were not upfront that we're a Google Analytics competitor. Some people were happy with the way we approached things and defended us but this feedback is something we will consider in future posts. 

  Our thinking that by not putting ourselves up on top of the post was to not try and appear too salesy or pushy. This is why we also included several competing alternatives to Google Analytics and why we listed our solution last in that list. The idea was to create the best possible post that looks into some of the issues with Google Analytics. We only put the mention of our product at the very end almost 2,500 words into the post. Perhaps we should put ourselves on the top of the next post and see what feedback we get then.

## What we plan to do next

So what's going to happen in the upcoming weeks and months? We plan to work on improving our product, our website, our communication and we plan to publish more useful content that people find interesting. 

You can argue that the only way from here in terms of traffic is down. We hit the ball out of the park on our first blog post but this is an incredible result that is impossible to achieve each and every time. It's important to have realistic expectations when trying to promote a company using organic means. 

We will do our best and try to make progress each and every month. Growing a startup is a marathon, it's not a sprint.
